# Virtual-Product-Owner
Project about changing the way we prioritize a backlog.  Transparency of the backlog to all stakeholders and allowing the ability for them to shape the backlog are the key points of this project.

The intention is to create a web based backend in ASP.Net MVC that will allow the Product Owner to setup and administer his backlog (if needed) and have web parts that can be added to any web site allowing users to see the backlog and vote up or down on each backlog item.  Thus allowing a calculation for ROI to happen and sort the backlog accordingly.
